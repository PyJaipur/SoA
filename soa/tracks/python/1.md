## Running Python

Python usually comes pre-installed if you're using a linux based system like [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), [Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/), or [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/). You can run the terminal application on these systems and just type `python` to access python.

A lot of us don't have a powerful machine at our disposal. If you think your machine won't be able to handle Python you can run it in your browser using things like [repl.it](https://repl.it/), [codechef.com/ide](https://www.codechef.com/ide), or [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com).

Once you have a running installation of python, [try to run the following code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1522564/how-do-i-run-a-python-program#1527012) and tell us what your program printed using the answer box below.

    import string
    print(string.printable[80])
