## Basic math

Python has a way to express mathematical operations so that you can do things
like `1+2` , `(4+5)*10` and so on. Since a program takes input from people and
gives them back some results, in python you can use `input()` and `print()` for
[working with input
output](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/taking-input-in-python). For example, a
program that asks a person for some input and then shows it to them twice could
be like this:

    a = input()
    print(a)
    print(a)

The python documentation has a nice informal [tutorial on how to use python as
a calculator](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html).  With this
information in hand, please go ahead and complete the following exercise on
hackerrank once you've [created an account
there](https://hackerrank.com/auth/signup).  You might need to know about
[basic math operations](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-operators-python/)
and [about integers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/type-conversion-python/) to
finish this problem.
