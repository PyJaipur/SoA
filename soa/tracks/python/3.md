## Decision Making

We make decisions everyday and based on them do either one thing or another. What should I cook? Does my bike need petrol?
Decisions in a program allow you to execute one path of the program or another based on the answer to some question. For example, here's a program that says "wow" if you give it an input of 2.

    x = input()
    if x == '2':
        print('wow')

We could also specify things to do if the condition we specify fails. You can read more about [if conditions in the python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements). Once you're done with if statements, please solve these problems on hackerrank.

Once you're done with attempting those let us know by typing in the result of the following program:

    x = '0'
    if x:
        print('non zero')
    else:
        print('zero')
