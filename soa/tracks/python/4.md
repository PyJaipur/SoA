## Strings

Strings are sequences of characters. Your name can be considered as a string. To create a string, put the sequence of characters inside quotes. Python does not care if they are single quotes or double quotes and so `'pyjaipur'` and  `"pyjaipur"` are the same value. You can read more about python string [in the python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings).

To solve this task, you'll want to go read about [string slices](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-slice-from-last-occurrence-of-k/) and [common string functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-test-if-string-contains-alphabets-and-spaces/). Once you're done with the reading, solve the following problems.
