# ML Track
Welcome to the ML track. We hope you're really excited for this.  
For starters we'll brush up your Python Skills. This includes your understanding of the following:  

- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)  
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)  
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)  

**Click [here](https://github.com/kabirnagpal/SoA-ML-14/blob/master/week%201.ipynb) to view the Jupyter-Notebook.**   
If you don't have any Python Environment, you can also try the code in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  


We hope you've gone through the code and other resources provided along. Let's wind it up with a quick question.
