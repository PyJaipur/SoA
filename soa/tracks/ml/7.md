# ML Track-Week 7

Congratulations for making it upto here!  

This week will introduce you to Dimensionality Reduction Techniques and Model Selection strategies like K cross fold validation, Grid Search and Stacking.  

Dimensionality Reduction means reducing the number of features(columns) in a given dataset.Imagine working with a dataset with nearly 20000 features.  
Having so many features makes it problematic to draw insights from the data. It's not feasible to analyze each and every variable at a microscopic level.  
Hence, we use Dimensionality Reduction techniques.  

Model selection,on the hand, is the process of selecting one final machine learning model from among a collection of candidate machine learning models for a training dataset.  

Let's start then, shall we?

If you don't have any Python Environment, you can also try the code in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  


We hope you've gone through the code and other resources provided along. Let's wind it up with a quick question.  
Kernel PCA cannot be used for non linear data. (True / False)
