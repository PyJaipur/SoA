## ML Track-Week 7

Congratulations for making it upto here !

This week will introduce you to Dimensionality Reduction Techniques and Model Selection strategies like K cross fold validation, Grid Search and Stacking.

Dimensionality Reduction means reducing the number of features(columns) in a given dataset.Imagine working with a dataset with nearly 20000 features. Having
so many features makes it problematic to draw insights from the data. Itâ€™s not feasible to analyze each and every variable at a microscopic level. Hence, we use Dimensionality Reduction techniques.

Model selection,on the hand, is the process of selecting one final machine learning model from among a collection of candidate machine learning models
for a training dataset.

Let's start then ,shall we ?

Kernel PCA cannot be used for non linear data. (true / false)
