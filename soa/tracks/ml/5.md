## Week 5
Congratulations! You have come mid-way!  
Now, let's learn how good or bad our model is performing and why?  

Topics covered in this week:  

1. Underfitting
2. Overfitting
3. Bias Variance Trade-off
4. Regularization
5. Support Vector Machine

**Click [here](https://github.com/kabirnagpal/SoA-ML-14/blob/master/week%205.ipynb) to view the Jupyter-Notebook.**  
If you don't have any Python Environment, you can also try the code in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  


We hope you've gone through the code and other resources provided along. Let's wind it up with a quick question.  
In terms of the bias-variance trade-off, which of the following is/are substantially more harmful to the test error than the training error? (Input the correct option)  

1. Bias
2. Loss
3. Variance
4. Risk
