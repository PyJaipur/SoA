# ML Track - Week 6
Congratulations!
You have come a long way! Till now we have been working on supervised machine learning , so, now gear up for the first chapter of unsupervised machine learning - Clustering .

Clustering is basically the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups.

So in this week we are going to dive deep into the clustering and cover the following topics: 

1. What is clustering?
2. Difference between clustering and clasification.
3. K-means clustering
4. Silhouette Score
5. Hierarchical clustering

If you don't have any Python Environment, you can also try the code in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  


We hope you've gone through the code and other resources provided along. Let's wind it up with a quick question.  
What is the name of the linkage that we have used in Agglomerative Clustering?
