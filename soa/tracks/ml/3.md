## ML Track - Week 3
Congratulations for making upto here!
As now we've completed the preprocessing methods, we can start with Machine Learing Algorithms.
We'll start with **Regression**.
Regression analysis is a supervised method, used to predict **Continous**, **Independent** variable using dependent variables.
This week will require you to have prior knowledge in linear, quadratic and polynomial equations.
This week we'll learn about:

- Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression

If you don't have any Python Environment, you can also try the code in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)


`mean_squared_error` is a method from which class in Sklearn?
