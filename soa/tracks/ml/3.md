# ML Track - Week 3

Congratulations for making upto here!  
As now we've completed the preprocessing methods, we can start with Machine Learing Algorithms.  
We'll start with **Regression**.  
Regression analysis is a supervised method, used to predict **Continous**, **Independent** variable using dependent variables.  
This week will require you to have prior knowledge in linear, quadratic and polynomial equations.  

This week we'll learn about: 

1. Linear Regression
2. Multiple Linear Regression
3. Polynomial Regression

**Click [here](https://github.com/kabirnagpal/SoA-ML-14/blob/master/week%203.ipynb) to view the Jupyter-Notebook.**   
If you don't have any Python Environment, you can also try the code in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  


We hope you've gone through the code and other resources provided along. Let's wind it up with a quick question.  
`mean_squared_error` is a method from which module in Sklearn?
