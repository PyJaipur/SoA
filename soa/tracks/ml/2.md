## ML Track - Week 2
We hope you're really excited to get started with actual Machine Learning. But just hold on!!
A big problem in machine learning algorithms is that, they're not humans. They are just bunch of formulas being applied in a loop of conditional statements.
So it cannot handle certain types of data like Strings. Also it will not be able to handle missing values.
These concept were discussed in last week tracks, and now is the time to learn in depth.
This week we'll learn about:

- One Hot encoding
- Label Encoding
- Normalization
- Dealing with Missing values
- Introduction to Machine learning
- Types of Learning (Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement)
- Application of Machine Learning

If you don't have any Python Environment, you can also try the code in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).


Write the command to One Hot encode Column named 'company' using pandas function on data frame `df`.
<form method='POST'>
  <input name='answer'>
  <input type='submit' value='Submit'>
  <code class='code_checker'>
    def answer(s):
        return s == "df['company'].get_dummies()"
  </code>
</form>
