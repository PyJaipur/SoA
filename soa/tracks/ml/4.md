# ML Track - Week 4
This week we are going to learn a type of widely used supervised machine learning algorithm - **Classification**.  

Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points.  

For example, spam detection in email service providers can be identified as a classification problem. This is a binary classification since there are only 2 classes : spam and not spam.  
A classifier utilizes some training data to understand how given input variables are related to the class.  

In this week, we will cover the following classifier algorithnms:  

1. Logistic Regression  
2. K-Nearest Neighbours  
3. Decision Tree Classifier  
4. Random Forest Classifier  
5. Voting Classifier

If you don't have any Python Environment, you can also try the code in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  


We hope you've gone through the code and other resources provided along. Let's wind it up with a quick question.  
What is the number of estimators used for Random Forest Classifier?
