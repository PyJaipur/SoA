## ML Track - Week 4
This week we are going to learn a type of widely used supervised machine learning algorithm - **Classification**.

Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points.

For example, spam detection in email service providers can be identified as a classification problem. This is a binary classification since there are only 2 classes : spam and not spam. A classifier utilizes some training data to understand how given input variables relate to the class.

In this week, we will cover the following classifier algorithnms:

  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Voting Classifier

If you don't have any Python Environment, you can also try the code in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)


What is the number of estimators used for Random Forest Classifier?
